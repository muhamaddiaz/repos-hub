‚ú® Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ‚ú®.

A modern monorepo containing multiple React applications built with Nx, featuring both Vite and Rsbuild configurations.

## üöÄ Applications

- **Default App** (`@repos-hub/repos-hub-default`) - Vite + React application
- **Enhanced App** (`@repos-hub/repos-hub-enhanced`) - Rsbuild + React application  
- **Shared UI** (`shared-ui`) - Shared component library

## üì¶ Quick Start

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm exec nx serve @repos-hub/repos-hub-default  # http://localhost:4200
pnpm exec nx dev @repos-hub/repos-hub-enhanced   # http://localhost:4200

# Build applications
pnpm exec nx build @repos-hub/repos-hub-default
pnpm exec nx build @repos-hub/repos-hub-enhanced

# Run tests
pnpm exec nx test @repos-hub/repos-hub-default
pnpm exec nx test @repos-hub/repos-hub-enhanced
```

## üåê GitHub Pages Deployment

This workspace is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

### Quick Deploy

```sh
# Using the helper script
./scripts/deploy-gh-pages.sh build both    # Build both apps
./scripts/deploy-gh-pages.sh preview both  # Build and preview locally
./scripts/deploy-gh-pages.sh deploy        # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

### Manual Deploy Commands

```sh
# Build for GitHub Pages
VITE_BASE_PATH="/repos-hub/" pnpm exec nx build @repos-hub/repos-hub-default
RSBUILD_PUBLIC_PATH="/repos-hub/" pnpm exec nx build @repos-hub/repos-hub-enhanced

# Push to main branch to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

## Generate a library

```sh
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
npx nx build pkg1
```

To run any task with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```
